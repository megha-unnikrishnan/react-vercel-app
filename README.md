Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App, a powerful tool to quickly set up a new React project with zero configuration.

Installation
To start using this project, ensure you have Node.js installed, then follow these steps:

Clone the repository or navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command to install all the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
This will download and install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.
Available Scripts
Once the installation is complete, you can use the following scripts in the project directory:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The app automatically reloads when you make changes to the code.
Any lint errors will be displayed in the console.
npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
Refer to the testing documentation for more details.
npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
Optimizes the React app for the best performance and bundles it with minification.
Filenames include hashes for caching.
Your app is now ready for deployment. See the deployment documentation for more information.

npm run eject
Caution: This is a one-way operation.

Once you eject, you can't undo it.
This command gives you full control by copying configuration files and dependencies like Webpack, Babel, and ESLint directly into your project.
Itâ€™s recommended only if you need to customize the build configuration.
